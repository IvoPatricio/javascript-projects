# javascript-projects
This repository contains my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS projects. It's a collection of projects I'm working on to improve my skills and explore different concepts in web development

# Overview
This repository includes various projects that cover both fundamental and advanced topics in web development. The projects utilize JavaScript for interactivity, HTML for structure, and CSS for styling. These projects are part of my self-learning journey, helping me strengthen my understanding of core web development concepts and improve my coding skills.

In the future, I plan to explore and incorporate React to build more dynamic, modern web applications as I continue expanding my knowledge in front-end development.
